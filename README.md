## Approach to build the app.

I am a fond of cool features and nice code. But my main objective is to get this challenging task to work properly. Once I do that, I will refactor my code.

## Domain knowledge

I learned what Liquidation preference is on Thursday evening. To be honest with you, I even had to go through investopedia to clarify Liquidation =)

Having said that, I may have used terms/wording which a person familiar in this domain may find it inappropriate or even worse, not logical. If by the time you are reading this you had already experience this, I am sorry. Feel free to correct where you deem is not good.

## Features

- Seniority Structure: Standard.
  The latest Serie has precedent over others for preferred shares.
  Meaning the preferred stocked of the last round of investors is the most prioritized.
- Dynamic settings. Edit on the go and see instant results (hopefully good ones :)

## Biggest obstacle

Before I rolled my sleeves to start coding, I spent a around 2-3 hours trying to understand the logic and read the tutorials which you provided in your gist. This itself was challenging but I really enjoyed learning about this topic.

When I had a good understanding of whats required, I started coded and produced a not-perfectly working application in a relatively short time.

However, as happens almost to every single time, I am finding it very challenging to come up with a nice UI design. This was definitely the most time consumer. I've built great UI pages in my career but with UI design provided to me. By the time I am writing this, I am still trying to find a good UI design :)
