## Approach to build the app.

I am a fond of cool features and neat code. But my main objective was to get this challenging task to work properly. Then, once I do that, I thought, It would not take much time to refactor the code and utilize modern features.

## Quality of code

:warning: Warning!. Wet and not-so-nice code can be seen in `App.js` :warning:

I usually put great effort into getting my code `WET` and neat.
As already stated, I focused on getting the product to work properly and when i did, I attempted to refactor (for a long 3 hours) the code but there were too many stuff breaking. So instead of trying to refactor my code, I invested more time into adding more features.

Excluding `App.js` all source code is of a good standard. But if I had to judge my own code, I would raise some flags when seeing the mentioned file.

## Domain knowledge

I learned what Liquidation preference is on Thursday evening. To be honest with you, I even had to go through investopedia to clarify Liquidation =)

Having said that, I may have used terms/wording which a person familiar in this domain may find it inappropriate or even worse, not logical. If by the time you are reading this you had already experience this, I am sorry. Feel free to correct where you deem is not good.

## Features

- Seniority Structure: Standard
  The latest Serie has precedent over others for preferred shares.
  Meaning the preferred stocked of the last round of investors is the most prioritized.
- Dynamic settings
  Edit on the go and see instant results (hopefully good ones :) )
- Multiplier
  From the brief and basic research which I did, and I hope I got this right, an investors can have a multiplier which would multiply his preferred shares. By default, this is set to 1.

## Biggest obstacle

Before I rolled my sleeves to start coding, I spent a around 2-3 hours trying to understand the logic and read the tutorials which you provided in your gist. This itself was challenging but I really enjoyed learning about this topic.

When I had a good understanding of whats required, I started coded and produced a not-perfectly working application in a relatively short time.

However, as happens almost to every single time, I am finding it very challenging to come up with a nice UI design. This was definitely the most time consumer. I've built great UI pages in my career but with UI design provided to me. By the time I am writing this, I am still trying to find a good UI design :)
